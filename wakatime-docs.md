Introduction
The WakaTime API follows common REST conventions. This means you should use GET requests to retrieve data and POST, PUT, or PATCH requests to modify data. All API requests must be done over HTTPS.

Every response will be a JSON object, which is a key-value hash. Data for a resource will be returned in the key named data. Errors will be returned in the key named errors or error.

HTTP response codes indicate the status of your request:

200 - Ok: The request has succeeded.
201 - Created: The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.
202 - Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The stats resource may return this code.
302 - Redirect: Sometimes we return 302 instead of 429, resulting in a request timeout. If that’s the case, try spreading out the number of requests you’re making over a few minutes instead of all at once.
400 - Bad Request: The request is invalid. Check error message and try again.
401 - Unauthorized: The request requires authentication, or your authentication was invalid.
403 - Forbidden: You are authenticated, but do not have permission to access the resource.
404 - Not Found: The resource does not exist.
429 - Too Many Requests: You are being rate limited, try making fewer than 10 requests per second on average over any 5 minute period.
500 - Server Error: Service unavailable, try again later.
All API resources have the url prefix https://api.wakatime.com/api/v1/.

When using the WakaTime trademark or logo in your application, please follow our usage guidelines.

Security
Do NOT use the API with your secret key on a public website. Instead, create an embeddable chart that's safe to share publicly. Choose the JSON format to securely access your coding activity with JavaScript:

Authentication
OAuth 2.0 Endpoints
Create an app to get an OAuth 2.0 client token.

The OAuth 2.0 provider endpoints are:

https://wakatime.com/oauth/authorize - Redirect your users here to request permission to access their account. Required url arguments are client_id, response_type of code or token, redirect_uri. Optional parameters are scope, state, force_approve.
https://wakatime.com/oauth/token - Make a server-side POST request here to get the secret access token. Required data is client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri must be the same url used in authorize step, grant_type of authorization_code, and the code received from the authorize step.
https://wakatime.com/oauth/revoke - Make a server-side POST request here to invalidate a secret access token. Required data is client_id, client_secret, and the token (access or refresh) to be invalidated.
For information about using these endpoints, see RFC6749 OAuth 2.0.

Using Access Token
After getting the bearer (access) token from https://wakatime.com/oauth/token, you can now make authenticated api calls using the Authorization request header (RFC 6750).

For example, if your user's access token is waka_tok_12345, you would add this header to your request:
Authorization: Bearer waka_tok_12345.

Alternatively, you can authenticate with url args named access_token, or just token and app_secret, client_secret, or just secret.

Using the Refresh Token
You should always get a refresh_token from the /oauth/token response. The refresh_token can be used when your access_token has expired, to re-authorize without having to prompt the user.

To use the refresh_token, make a POST request to https://wakatime.com/oauth/token to get a new secret access token. Required data is client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri must be the same url used in authorize step, grant_type of refresh_token, and the refresh_token received from a previous token response.

Revoking Tokens
Your app should revoke tokens when users disconnect their WakaTime integration, delete their account on your app, or you no longer need access to a user’s account. To revoke an access token, and it’s corresponding refresh token, send a POST request to /oauth/revoke containing your app’s client_id, client_secret, and the token (access or refresh token) that you would like to revoke. Both JSON (Content-Type: application/json) and form-urlencoded (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded) are supported as the POST body. The response status will be 200 success if the token is successfully disabled. If the token is already revoked or expired, this endpoint will still respond with a 200 success response.

For example:

POST /oauth/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: wakatime.com
Content-Type: application/json

{"client_id":"XXX","client_secret":"waka_sec_XXX","token":"waka_tok_12345"}

To revoke all tokens for a user, send user_id along with your app’s client_id and client_secret:

POST /oauth/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: wakatime.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=XXX
client_secret=waka_sec_XXX
user_id=12345

Or, revoke all tokens for a user using a past access or refresh token for that user, with all=true:

POST /oauth/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: wakatime.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=XXX
client_secret=waka_sec_XXX
all=true
token=waka_tok_12345

Or, revoke all tokens for all users of your app:

POST /oauth/revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: wakatime.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=XXX
client_secret=waka_sec_XXX
all=true

Scopes
Scopes are sent to the authorize url as a space or comma separated list, to request optional permissions for a user.

read_summaries - access user’s Summaries and Stats including categories, dependencies, editors, languages, machines, operating systems, and projects. Consider instead requesting scopes for only the summaries you need. For ex: scope=read_summaries.languages,read_summaries.editors to only request access to the user’s language and editor summaries and stats.
read_summaries.categories - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s categories.
read_summaries.dependencies - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s dependencies.
read_summaries.editors - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s editors.
read_summaries.languages - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s languages.
read_summaries.machines - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s machines.
read_summaries.operating_systems - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s operating systems.
read_summaries.projects - access user’s Summaries and Stats, limited to the user’s projects.
read_stats - access user’s Stats including categories, dependencies, editors, languages, machines, operating systems, and projects. Consider instead requesting scopes for only the stats you need. For ex: scope=read_stats.languages,read_stats.editors to only request access to the user’s language and editor stats.
read_stats.best_day - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s best day in the requested time range.
read_stats.categories - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s categories.
read_stats.dependencies - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s dependencies.
read_stats.editors - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s editors.
read_stats.languages - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s languages.
read_stats.machines - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s machines.
read_stats.operating_systems - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s operating systems.
read_stats.projects - access user’s Stats, limited to the user’s projects.
read_goals - access user’s Goals.
read_orgs - access user’s organizations, and coding activity for dashboard members.
write_orgs - modify user’s organizations, and org dashboards.
read_private_leaderboards - access user’s private leaderboards.
write_private_leaderboards - modify user’s private leaderboards, including adding/removing members when current user had Admin or Owner role.
read_heartbeats - access user’s coding activity, projects, files, editors, languages, operating systems, dependencies, Stats, Durations, External Durations, and Heartbeats. If you don’t need access to Durations or Heartbeats, consider only requesting read_summaries scope instead.

email - access user’s private email address; not necessary for user’s public email and public profile info.
Example
OAuth 2.0 authentication flow using rauth (Python):

#!/usr/bin/env python

import hashlib
import os
import sys
from rauth import OAuth2Service

if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
    raw_input = input

print('Find your App Id at wakatime.com/apps')
client_id = raw_input('Enter your App Id: ')
client_secret = raw_input('Enter your App Secret: ')

service = OAuth2Service(
    client_id=client_id,  # your App ID from https://wakatime.com/apps
    client_secret=client_secret,  # your App Secret from https://wakatime.com/apps
    name='wakatime',
    authorize_url='https://wakatime.com/oauth/authorize',
    access_token_url='https://wakatime.com/oauth/token',
    base_url='https://wakatime.com/api/v1/')

redirect_uri = 'https://wakatime.com/oauth/test'
state = hashlib.sha1(os.urandom(40)).hexdigest()
params = {'scope': 'email,read_stats.languages',
          'response_type': 'code',
          'state': state,
          'redirect_uri': redirect_uri}

url = service.get_authorize_url(**params)

print('**** Visit this url in your browser ****')
print('*' * 80)
print(url)
print('*' * 80)
print('**** After clicking Authorize, paste code here and press Enter ****')
code = raw_input('Enter code from url: ')

# Make sure returned state has not changed for security reasons, and exchange
# code for an Access Token.
headers = {'Accept': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
print('Getting an access token...')
session = service.get_auth_session(headers=headers,
                                   data={'code': code,
                                         'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
                                         'redirect_uri': redirect_uri})

print('Getting current user from API...')
user = session.get('users/current').json()
print('Authenticated via OAuth as {0}'.format(user['data']['email']))
print("Getting user's code stats from API...")
stats = session.get('users/current/stats')
print(stats.text)
Using refresh_token to get a new access_token when the previous one has expired, using rauth (Python):

import requests
from urllib.parse import parse_qsl

refresh_token = dict(parse_qsl(session.access_token_response.text))['refresh_token']

data = {
    'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
    'client_id': client_id,
    'client_secret': client_secret,
    'refresh_token': refresh_token,
}
resp = requests.post('https://wakatime.com/oauth/token', data=data, timeout=5)
print(resp.text)
# Or, using the rauth library:
# session = service.get_auth_session(data=data)
Limits
Each app is allowed 8 active OAuth tokens per user.

New tokens are rate limited to 10 per user per hour.

If an app creates more than 8 tokens for the same user then the oldest token is revoked to make room for the new token, except when hitting the 10 per hour rate limit.

OAuth tokens using response_type=code expire after 365 days.

OAuth tokens using response_type=token expire after 12 hours.

Make sure to re-use tokens instead of requesting new ones, and revoke tokens if you’re no longer using them.

400 Error (Invalid redirect_uri: Not valid for this client.)
If you see this error when running the example, add https://wakatime.com/oauth/test as an authorized redirect url in your App's settings.

Using API Key
Most apps should use OAuth, but you can also authenticate to the WakaTime API using your secret API Key.

Using HTTP Basic Auth pass your API Key base64 encoded in the Authorization header. Don't forget to prepend Basic  to your api key after base64 encoding it.

For example, when using HTTP Basic Auth with an api key of 12345 you should add this header to your request:
Authorization: Basic MTIzNDU=

That’s because when you decode the base64 string "MTIzNDU=" you get "12345".

Alternatively, you can pass your api key as a query parameter in your request like ?api_key=XXXX.

Do NOT use your API Key on a public website. Instead, use embeddable charts and JSON.

Writing your own plugin
WakaTime plugins are extensions that run inside your text editor or IDE sending usage stats, called heartbeats, to your WakaTime Dashboard. All official WakaTime plugins are open source on GitHub.

When building your own editor plugin, use our Creating a WakaTime plugin guide.

Embedding Charts & JSON
Want to share your WakaTime stats? Use the embeddable charts and JSON to safely embed your coding activity on a public website without leaking your secret api key. Select the JSON format for access to your code stats in JavaScript. We don’t support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) because the only way to access your code stats safely in public JavaScript is with embeddable JSON. Embeddable JSON does support JSONP. Embeddable charts and JSON use a one-time unique url and can be retracted to prevent future access to your code stats.

Never use the WakaTime API from a public website, except for embeddables. Using your secret api key in client-side JavaScript gives everyone on the internet full access to your WakaTime account.

POST /api/v1/users/current/external_durations

POST /api/v1/users/:user/external_durations.bulk

POST /api/v1/users/current/external_durations.bulk

Description
Creates a duration representing activity for a user with start and end time, when Heartbeat pings aren’t available. For ex: meetings. External durations are not created by IDE plugins, only OAuth apps can create external durations. External durations must be created within one year from Today, and must not start before the associated user’s account was created. Use external_id to prevent creating duplicate durations. Using the same external_id will update any existing duration with the provided attributes. The bulk endpoint accepts an array of external durations, limited to 1,000 per POST request. The bulk endpoint will return 201 response status code with an array of status_codes for each duration sent. That’s because most invalid durations can be ommitted without problems while still allowing your app’s valid durations.

Stats
GET /api/v1/users/:user/stats

GET /api/v1/users/current/stats

GET /api/v1/users/:user/stats/:range

GET /api/v1/users/current/stats/:range

Description
A user's coding activity for the given time range. Optional range can be a YYYY year, YYYY-MM month, or one of last_7_days, last_30_days, last_6_months, last_year, or all_time. When range isn’t present, the user’s public profile range is used. For accounts subscribed to the free plan, time ranges >= one year are updated on the first request. It’s best to always check is_up_to_date and retry your request when the response is stale. Stats are read-only representations of Heartbeats, Durations, and Summaries, created by joining multiple Heartbeats together when they’re within 15 minutes of each other. The 15 minutes default can be changed with your account’s Keystroke Timeout preference.

URL Parameters
timeout - Integer - optional - The keystroke timeout value used to calculate these stats. Defaults the the user's keystroke timeout value.

writes_only - Boolean - optional - The writes_only value used to calculate these stats. Defaults to the user's writes_only setting.

GET /api/v1/users/current/summaries

Description
A user's coding activity for the given time range as an array of summaries segmented by day. Summaries are read-only representations of Heartbeats and Durations, created by joining multiple Heartbeats together when they’re within 15 minutes of each other. The 15 minutes default can be changed with your account’s Keystroke Timeout preference.

URL Parameters
start - Date - required - Start date of the time range.

end - Date - required - End date of the time range.

project - String - optional - Only show time logged to this project.

branches - String - optional - Only show coding activity for these branches; comma separated list of branch names.

timeout - Integer - optional - The keystroke timeout preference used when joining heartbeats into durations. Defaults the the user's keystroke timeout value. See the FAQ for more info.

writes_only - Boolean - optional - The writes_only preference. Defaults to the user's writes_only setting.

timezone - String - optional - The timezone for given start and end dates. Defaults to the user's timezone.

range - String - optional - Alternative way to supply start and end dates. Can be one of “Today”, “Yesterday”, “Last 7 Days”, “Last 7 Days from Yesterday”, “Last 14 Days”, “Last 30 Days”, “This Week”, “Last Week”, “This Month”, or “Last Month”.
